## Exercise 20

I chose the Patientor application from Part 9 - Typescript, which I hope is sufficient for this exercise. This was the only application available to me since I began the course from part 8 due to previous course knowledge from my university. The application lacks tests which does hurt the integrity of the CI/CD workflow, but there was heavy refactoring from backend and frontend folder to the monorepo structure that is currently present.
